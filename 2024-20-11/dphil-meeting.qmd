## Agenda
1. First paper
    * High RP storms
2. Second paper
    * Discuss possibility of dataset paper
3. Third paper
    * Discuss possibility of using variation of Generative AI chapter from book

## First paper
#### Things tried -- DiffAugment
1. Add [DiffAugment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10738) to existing WGAN-GP model -- didn't make noticeable difference
2. Using StyleGAN2+DiffAugment
    * Requires NVIDIA GPUs -- we have on cluster
    * Very specific environment set up -- haven't managed to do alone and IT very busy for week 0
    * Theoretically should produce decent images from only 100 training images (100-shot)

## First paper
#### DiffAugment
![StyleGAN2+DiffAugment 100-shot interpolation](imgs/interp.gif)

* Interpolating through the latent space
* 3-channel RGB images

## First paper
#### Notes
* Pre-training dataset of ~170,000 normal climate wind and precipitation footprints (2-20 day durations). No canonical way to pretrain, unsure of best approach.
* Reran original WGAN-GP code on samples (single-channel for now)

## Second paper
#### Dataset paper + analysis
* Provided reach certain level of confidence in model
* Compound hazards + infrastructure
* More examples/dataset to show potential of the model

## Second paper
#### Damage curve shifts
* Damage curves should be different for different seasons and conditions
    * Trees catch more wind when they have leaves and fall more easily when soil is wet
    * More likely to fall over when wind comes from an unusual direction becauses roots aren't grown to support that

## Second paper
#### Examples
* Colin Manning (Uni Manchester): seasonal damage curves, importance of wind direction, wetness exacerbates damage probability
* Tom Harwood: importance of seasonality when assessing heat stress

## Second paper
#### Damage curve shifts

## Third paper
#### ML&AI for Climate and Weather Chapter 6: Generative Modelling
* Focus on methods and concepts likely to _stand the test of time_
* Workbook-style with code examples
* Forecasting ensemble models, e.g., GenCast
* Extreme events and large-scale climate risk assessments (my stuff)

## Third paper
#### ML&AI for Climate and Weather Chapter 6: Generative Modelling
